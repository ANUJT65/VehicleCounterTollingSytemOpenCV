The proposed project introduces an innovative and accountable car tolling system designed to ensure transparency, accuracy, and the prevention of corruption in road infrastructure. Leveraging advanced technologies such as electronic toll collection and automated monitoring, the system guarantees the precise counting of vehicles. 

This Python script serves the purpose of implementing a vehicle counting system using OpenCV, specifically designed for tolling systems.
The technology stack includes the OpenCV library,numpy etc. The script employs background subtraction to detect moving vehicles, utilizing contours for precise identification.
The script counts vehicles crossing a designated line, making it a valuable tool for monitoring toll booth activity.
The original video and an augmented version, highlighting detected vehicles, are displayed in real-time and both screen shots are provided here
Users can stop the process with a simple Enter key press.

This tool addresses the importance of accurate vehicle counting in tolling systems, ensuring transparency and efficiency in toll collection.
